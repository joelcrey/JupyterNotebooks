A Binder repo for the stuff I made with SageMath
================================================

If you click the button below, an environment in Binder will be generated to interact with my Jupyter Notebooks.

My Jupyter Notebooks
____________________
1. The notebook 'hanmonskyalgorithm' contains just one cell. The main functions are HK_diagonal and eHK_diagonal, which compute the Hilbert–Kunz function and Hilbert–Kunz multiplicity of a diagonal hypersurface via the Han–Monsky algorithm.
2. The notebook 'volumeestimates' goes through the different proofs of the Watanabe–Yoshida conjecture in low dimension, producing pictures illustrating the comparison between the volume estimates given by Aberbach, Cox-Steib, Enescu, Watanabe, and Yoshida in dimensions 3 through 7, and compares them to the value in characteristic 2 computed in [CR25].
