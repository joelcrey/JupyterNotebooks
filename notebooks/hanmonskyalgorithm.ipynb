    "# On choosing $e_0$\n",
    "I concluded that choosing an $e_0$ is necessary even when the hypotheses of the theorems in section 5 of Han and Monsky's paper are relaxed to the remark. Take the example $\\beta = (\\frac{1}{12},\\frac{1}{7},\\frac{1}{8})$ and $p=3$. In this case, $z=\\beta$, and one can check that there are only $6$ possible values of $z'$ (by changing $\\mu$) and none of them give you $z \\sim z'$ or $z^* \\sim z'$. Thus, changing $\\beta$ by $p^{e_0}\\beta$ is necessary. And this can be proven that it is sufficient to take the maximum $e_0$ such that $p^{e_0}$ divides all the denominators in $\\beta$. Then, once you change $\\beta$ by $p^{e_0}\\beta$, you get something for which you can find a suitable $\\mu$. And $e_0$ cannot be chosen smaller, but you can take multiples of it, which Han and Monsky use to force the hypotheses. But I have to try to avoid it, since it increases computational weight.\n",

That seems like a good enough guess. Because checking one by one, the diagonal hypersurface $[63,67,71,53,89]$ would already take hours to find a mu. However, the mu seems to be very high, so I don't think it is worth it anyway."
